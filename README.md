# Theater Marketing Outcomes
Module 1 Challenge

  1. Overview of the Project
  - Louise has been fundraising different projects over the past decade using the crowdfunding service Kickstarter. 
  In order to improve the success rates of funding these projects, we can use the data gathered by each fundraising event to see if there are any correlations that will help drive the success of each project. 
  Specifically the play **Fever** was a rapidly funded project in a short amount of time.
  The success of this specific project led to questioning about how Launch Dates and Funding Goals compare with the crowdfunding outcome. 
  
  2. Analysis and Challenges
  - In order to determine if there was a correlation between the start date and the success of a project we decided to organize the data in a PivotTable. 
  PivotTables allow for quick rearrangement and sorting of a large dataset in excel. 
  Filtering out specifically theater projects and sorting the data from all years into monthly order you can see a large spike in successful campaigns when the start date is in May.
  The failed or cancelled projects hold steady with minor fluctuation throughout the year.

  - Additionally Louise was interested in finding what goals are more attainable for future projects. By examining what percentage of projects are successful based on the dollar amount goal, you can see in the graph below that from 0-$20,000 more than 50% or more of the projects were successful.
Above that a short range from $35,000-45,000 were also above a 60% success rate. Any higher of a goal was sure to be a flop.

  3. Results
  - Conclusions based on Launch Date
    - The best time to launch a project would be in April and continue through August, any later or earlier in the year would miss the summer peak success rate
    - There is minimal correlation between the launch date and total number of failed projects
  - Conlusion based on Goals
    - It is best to keep goals of $20,000 or less. Any more and it appears to deter donors from good faith that the project will meet its goal and results in less donors. Never exceed $45,000.
  - Data Summary
    - Since this data is only showing Theater there may be a specific trend in that industry, I would recommend reviewing another industry to see if the seasonal spike is seen across the board.
    - These graphs have combined data from multiple years, it would also be useful to know over time how the successful projects have fared on a yearly basis to know if the same patterns are seen each year.
